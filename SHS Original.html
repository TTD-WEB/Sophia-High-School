                   <div class="content"><p>Sophia High School, situated on 70, Palace Road, Bangalore is an all girls, Catholic institution founded in 1949 by Mother Andersson of the Religious Order of the Sacred Heart. Since 1972, the school has been run by the Sisters of Notre Dame under the Barat Society and is placed under the patronage of Mary, Mother of Jesus. </p>

                   <p> Situated in the sylvan surroundings of central Bangalore, Sophia High School is one of the finest examples of premier English education in the city. Founded in January 1949, Sophia is enriched by the patronage of two saintly religious women; St Madeline Sophie Barat, and St. Julie Billiart, the founders of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart and the Sisters of Notre Dame respectively.</p>
                    
                   <p>In 1972 the Society of the Sacred Heart reviewed their strategy in India, and handed off several local schools, including Sophia High School, to other Catholic groups, in order to focus on schools that needed funding and attention, especially in India's rural areas. Sophia High School was taken over by the School Sisters of Notre Dame.</p>
                    
                   <p>Since then the school has grown significantly. The school's current enrollment is over 2,000 students. The school is not a religious organization and its students, who are chosen through a competitive interview process, are from many different ethnicities. The founding "white bungalow" still stands on campus and was remodeled in 1998.</p>
                    
                   <p></p> The Times of India has called it one of Bangalore's "legendary" schools with "a historic past", and one of the city's "top schools" which, before the 1990s, "had identities that went beyond their names.</p></div>

In addition to striving for excellence in academics, the school also seeks to impart a strong sense of personal integrity and fundamental values to our students. We believe that we are responsible for facilitating the growth of well-adjusted individuals who are assets to the various personal and professional communities that they belong to. Towards this, we inculcate in our students personal and professional well-being, wisdom, excellence and compassion. Consequently, we send forth young women with a profound capacity for giving, sensitivity and the ability to respond empathetically to the social realities of their times.</p>

                         institution regrdless of their religion, culture, gender, etc. A feeling of unity is 
                         aroused by this act. This feeling of unity stays forever in the students' mind and it leads to a happy society.
                         Assemblies provide a fantastic opporunity to build a strong sense of community.
                         The program of the assemblies has the potential to nurture and maintain a positive and 
                         healthy school culture which binds everyone together.</p>
                         <p>Sophia High School believes that assemblies play an important role in the lives of students. 
                            Whether online or offline, the students of Sophia are made to conduct assemblies on a regular basis.</p>

            &nbsp;
            <p>On the 19th of February, 2022, the CUMA, i.e. the Cuvilly and Mater section (classes 5, 6 and 7)
                of Sophia High School had organised a science, needlework and art exhibition.
                This exhibition was based on the theme of the year 2022 National Science Day, "International
                Approach in science and technology for Sustainable Future". The caption of this exhibition was
                "Small ideas can grow into BIG realities". It was a wonderful experience where the students were able to
                learn science in an interactive way. It also enabled them to showcase their talents.
